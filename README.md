# Scaling font 

As you may know, Linux currently has limited support for fractional scaling, and using FULL HD on a small screen, such as this laptop, results in all elements appearing too small. While I initially focused on scaling only the system font, this adjustment affected the overall UI scaling, including the dimensions of various elements.

So, how can you address this issue?

The solution involves installing [Gnome tweaks] ( https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-tweaks), which can be easily installed using your distribution's package manager. Once installed, open Gnome Tweaks and navigate to the 'Fonts' section. Set the scaling to 1.20, and you will notice a more balanced and visually pleasing display."


# Improve sound 
To improve the sound download "Easy Effect" and import the profile you find in the repository this will greatly improve the sound.
Remember through the Easy Effect settings to set auto start so that the service starts together with the system.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should be able to overcome Linux-related challenges on your DELL XPS 7390 and enjoy a seamless computing experience.
